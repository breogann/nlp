soyungalgo,Mi danza (feat. Dani de Morón),Fuel Fandango,"[Letra de ""Mi Danza""]

[Verso 1]
Deja que la vida brote
Donde menos te lo esperas
Deja que se abra camino
Y trepe como enredadera
Deja que me lleve el aire
Hacia un futuro nuevo
Deja que vuelva al origen
Y que desaparezca el miedo

[Estribillo]
Que empiece la parranda
El jaleo que me abraza (Olé, chiquilla)
Este compás que arrasa
Mi danza, mi danza, mi danza
El jaleo que me abraza
Mi danza, mi danza, mi danza, mi danza

[Verso 2]
Deja mis semillas brotar, brillar
Ya no soy como era
Abro la puerta de par en par
Cantaré hasta el día que me muera
Deja que me salgan alas
Déjame volar del nido
Deja que vuelva al origen
Y que desaparezca el miedo

[Estribillo]
Que empiece la parranda
El jaleo que me abraza (Olé, chiquilla)
Este compás que arrasa
Mi danza, mi danza, mi danza
El jaleo que me abraza
Mi danza, mi danza, mi danza

[Puente]
Quiero volver a ver
Mi piel bailando en el río
Déjame vivir sencilla
O vete por donde has venido

[Estribillo]
Que empiece la parranda
El jaleo que me abraza (Olé, chiquilla)
Este compás que arrasa
Mi danza, mi danza, mi danza
El jaleo que me abraza
Mi danza, mi danza, mi danza"
soyungalgo,MERICHANE,Zahara,"[Letra de ""MERICHANE""]

[Estrofa 1]
Yo estaba ahí cuando todos bailaban
Mojaban el dedo, se creían eternos
Yo estaba en el baño aguantando la puerta con mi espalda
Mientras les besaba la lengua
Yo estaba ahí en las oficinas de Universal
Tragando sermones sobre mi gran potencial
Yo estaba ahí abrazada a la taza del váter
Yo era incapaz de soltarla y ellos de mirarme

[Estrofa 2]
Yo estaba ahí en urgencias acariciando el límite
Necesitaba algo infalible
Yo estaba de rodillas pidiеndo perdón a vuestro Dios
Por no saber dеcirle que no

[Estribillo]
Yo-o-o-o
A-a-aún ahí y sin saber salir
Yo-o-o-o
A-a-aún ahí, sin saber salir
Y no logro huir

[Estrofa 3]
Yo estaba ahí cambiándole el nombre a mis amantes
En la lista de contactos
Yo estaba ahí dejándole las bragas usadas en el armario
Jodiéndole la vida a un extraño
Yo estaba en la otra habitación, escuchaba su respiración
Deseaba que no entrase
Yo estaba entre las sábanas ásperas del verano
Dejando de ser quién había soñado
[Estribillo]
Yo-o-o-o
A-a-aún ahí y sin saber salir
Y no logro sacarme de allí

[Estrofa 4]
Yo estaba ahí con las llaves en la mano
Acelerando el paso, fingiendo que hablaba con mi hermano
Yo estaba ahí dejándome hacer
Con tal de que acabase de una vez
Yo estaba ahí confesándome por haberme tocado
Creyendo que ese era el puto pecado
Yo estaba ahí metiéndome los dedos hasta el fondo
Queriendo vomitar las penas, la vida, el odio

[Estribillo]
Yo-o-o-o
A-a-aún ahí y sin saber salir
Yo-o-o-o
A-a-aún ahí, sin saber salir
Y no logro, no sé cómo sacarme de allí"
toni085,Olaf el vikingo,LOS NIKIS,"Todos en la tribu le tienen miedo
Olaf el vikingo es fro como el hielo
No hay nada, no hay nadie
Que detenga sus impulsos de barbarie
Come carne, carne cruda
Ruedan las cabezas en caso de duda
Habla con la boca llena
Y hace su ensalada con aceite de ballena
No existe el miedo para Olaf
No existe el miedo
No existe el miedo
Olaf el vikingo no tiene miedo
Nadie entra en su fiordo
Porque pronto se iran al fondo
Olaf no piensa, Olaf no escucha
Solo quiere empezar la lucha
Ya no quedan enemigos
Olaf el vikingo est muy aburrido
Ahora trabaja en la trata de blancas
Y pasa las tardes jugando a la petanca
No existe el miedo para Olaf
No existe el miedo
No existe el miedo
Olaf el vikingo no tiene miedo"

[Chorus]
Propose a toast, you know
Made the most with your highs and lows
Stick to the code, you know, same as before
Gang La Cosa Nostra
I don't know so and so, who may assume
Staying at home, I'm low-key
We can all rise or fall, this ain't before
The fame is taking over

[Verse]
I don't know so and so, I don't assume you do
Hop out a Volvo, that bitch go vroom-vroom
I'm with my dogs-dogs, they'll go woof-woof
You niggas all bark-bark, but they all poodles
Anything for dough, your bro sold his soul
Back up in effect, she told me that I am up next
Might get me tatted on her neck, it ain't no cattle for the set
You wanna battle, then how much you wanna bet?
Put a hundred thousand on it, yeah, yeah, yeah
Got the plate with salmon on it, yeah, yeah
Every day a ceremony, yeah, yeah
I feel like Tim in San Antonio
I flip the flow, the flow, the same as before
At least a plus four, gang, you know
I never went alone to no nigga show
I don't be on the phone, you ain't my bro
Better come correct with the quote, mm
I ain't made a mill', but I'm close, mm
That's why I need the digit for the show, mm
We ain't talking, I ain't social
[Chorus]
Propose a toast, you know
Made the most with your highs and lows
Stick to the code, you know, same as before

toni085,Algorithm,Muse,"[Verse 1]
Supercomputer status, walkin' along streets
Everyone is an addict, stumbling concrete
What was the motivation? Constant communication
Everybody wanna get chose like Moses
Came out Mother Earth smelling like roses
Summon the new edition, made it way too efficient
Made us the guinea pig and did it with no permission
Told it to call a friend, didn't tell it to listen
So very scary, so binary, zero or one
Like or dislike, coal mine canary
I dream in color, not black and white
You sell your daughter on that data stream
Dopamine make it hit now
Humans don't understand, humans gon' sell a lie
Humans gotta survive, we know we gon' die
Nothing can live forever, you know we gon' try
Life, is it really worth it? The algorhythm is perfect, mmh

[Chorus]
Everybody (Everybody), move your body, now do it (Now do it)
Here is something (Ooh), that's gonna make you move and groove
(Please don't lose that tempo)
Algorhythm
(Moving how they say so)
Algorhythm

[Verse 2]
Step, step, slide, slide
Move your body from side to side
Clap your hands, don't spite the vibe
Keep on moving, you might survive
Pressure is to evolve, take a bite of the apple
We crush it into the sauce, how do we know the cost?
How do we know the truth without feeling what could be false?
Freedom of being wrong, freedom of being lost
Wait a minute, wait a minute (Wait a minute, wait a minute)
Feelin' like the devil did it (Devil did it, ooh)
Lord willing, I'ma step to it (Step to it)
You gon' fall behind if you can't do it (Ooh, yeah)
Ooh, we eating good over here now (Yeah)
Is you eating good over there now? (No)
Human ain't the move, do I care now? (No)
Looking for something worth it, the algorhythm is perfect, mmh

[Chorus]
Everybody (Everybody), move your body, now do it (Now do it)
Here is something (Ooh), that's gonna make you move and groove
(Please don't lose that tempo)
Algorhythm
(Moving how they say so)
Algorhythm (Woo)
Everybody (Everybody), move your body, now do it (Now do it)
Here is something (Ooh), that's gonna make you move and groove

copia002,Ca plane pour moi,Plastic Bertrand,"[Verse 1]
Wham! Bam! My cat, Splash
Is rolling around on my bed
He swallowed his tongue as he drank all my whisky
As for me, I've hardly slept, I feel empty and reprimanded
I had to sleep in the gutter
Where I had a flash of inspiration
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
In four colours

[Verse 2]
OK, let's go! One morning
A babe came round to my house
She looked like a cellophane doll with curly hair
She was wearing a plaster and had a hangover
She drank my beer in a large rubber glass
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Just like an Indian might do in his igloo

[Chorus]
It's all working out for me, it's all working out for me
It's all working out for me-me-me-me-me
It's all working out for me
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
It's all working out for me
[Verse 3]
OK, let's go! That babe was such a bitch
What a vibration!
Coming on the doormat
Filed down, ruined, empty, but happy
""You are the King of the Divan!""
She says to me in passing
I am the King of the Divan

[Chorus]
It's all working out for me, it's all working out for me
It's all working out for me-me-me-me-me
It's all working out for me
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
It's all working out for me

[Verse 4]
OK, let's go! Mind your own, keep your nose out
Don't harm my planet
Today's not the day the sky will fall down around my ears
Or that I will have to go without a drink
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
It's all working out for me

[Verse 4]
OK, let's go! my baby upped and left
She walked out on me, it's a shitty situation
She broke everything, the sink, the bar
And she left me all alone
Like a total jerk
Stuck here faced with the aftermath
[Chorus]
It's all working out for me, it's all working out for me
It's all working out for me-me-me-me-me
It's all working out for me
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
It's all working out for me
It's all working out for me, it's all working out for me
It's all working out for me-me-me-me-me
It's all working out for me"
soyungalgo,Fantasya,Pedro LaDroga,"[Verse 1]
Oh, when you walk by every night
Talking sweet and looking fine
I get kind of hectic inside
Mmm, baby, I'm so into you
Darling, if you only knew
All the things that flow through my mind

[Chorus]
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
When I close my eyes, you come and take me
On and on and on, it's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby (Fantasy)
(And I want you so bad)

[Verse 2]
Images of rapture
Creep into me slowly
As you're going to my head
And my heart beats faster
When you take me over
Time and time and time again

[Chorus]
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
When I close my eyes, you come and take me
On and on and on, it's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby (Fantasy)
Oh, oh, it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
When I close my eyes you come and take me
On and on and on, it's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby (Fantasy)
[Bridge]
I'm in heaven
With my boyfriend, my laughing boyfriend
There's no beginning and there is no end
Feels like I'm dreaming, but I'm not sleeping

[Chorus]
Oh, it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
When I close my eyes, you come and take me
On and on and on, it's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
Sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
When I close my eyes, you come and take me
On and on and on, it's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
Sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
Sweet, sweet fantasy, baby"

Fui a la discoteca a ver si me conseguía una fresca
Got myself some rum
Cause where I'm from sometimes you need some
Me tomé mi trago y una princesa pasó por mi lado
La miré con ganas con esa carita de fama
Ella miró OH SI! Ella pasó OH NO!
Ella se volvió con una sonrisa
Tengo que bailar con esa muñequita
La invitó y puso brinca
Y enseguida quise jalarla pa' la pista

Okey, tanto, encontré otra chica que estaba mejor
Bailamos tres merengues de corrido y gozamos
Luego nos sentamos, ordenamos bebidas y conversamos
She look good, so of course I lied all my girls from the hood
Ella preguntó si tenía novia y yo dije no
Me quité el anillo, despacito me lo metí en el bolsillo
Vino un descarado y me dijo : ¡Jo!...¿Tú no eres casado?
Me quedé pasmado y enseguida se la llevó de mi lado

1182774545,Spinnerei,Planet Caravan,"[Part 1:]
Das Dankfest des Feuers, die Ernte der Schonzeit
Charakter, gebildet, gelernt aus Gewohnheit
Eine sterbende Hoheit, ein Barbar, der am Leben ist
Mein Himmel, meine Hölle, mein Hades, mein Eleusis
Religion, Spinnerei, das All aus der Retorte
Verständnis entzieht sich der Gewalt deiner Worte
Der Geist, der alles vereinigt, fühlt sich nicht einsam
Mein Verständnis, meine Wahrheit, meine Lüge, mein Eiland
Himmlisch göttliche Zirkel, teuflische Kreise
Meine Dichtung, meine Kunst, die Bäume des Geistes
Herrschaft, Kontrolle, gewollt und nicht verstanden
Das Objekt im Subjekt, verschmolzen zu Mutanten
Das Subjekt im Objekt, falscher Halt für die Seele
Kristalle des Elends, das Salz in der Träne
Im Angesichte des Todes feiert das Leben den Einstand
Mein Anker, mein Fels, mein Eden, mein Eiland

[Sample:]
""Wer denkt, er sei mehr als die anderen, muss sich zum Friedhof begeben. Dort wird er sehen, was das Leben wirklich ist: Es ist eine handvoll Staub.""

[Part 2:]
Reden ist mein Spiel, Schweigen ist mein Trumpf
Alleine sind wir nichts, gemeinsam sind wir dumm
Der alternde Geist bleibt jung, hermetisch hinter der Öffnung
Mein Wille, mein Weg, mein Planet, meine Schöpfung
Ein Käfig, ein Muster, der Verstand hat es in sich
Geschaffen, verzerrt, als Krankheit verinnerlicht
Der Schlammspringer schwimmt nicht, er bewegt sich im Treibsand
Meine Krippe, mein Galgen, mein Leben, mein Eiland
Verstandlos in der Gegenwart, hinterher ist man klüger
Himmel und Hölle stehen nicht dazwischen, sondern darüber
Ein wütender Minotauros, ein ängstliches Einhorn
Grenzen gesprengt, Existenz in ihrer Reinform
Einheitsbrei, Einerlei, Affen beim Ententanz
Ein Zirkus, ein Käfig, geschaffen von Menschenhand
Kontemplation im Treibsand, Elend auf der Leinwand
Mein Anker, mein Fels, mein Eden, mein Eiland
[Sample:]
""Wir alle sind Co-Autoren dieser tanzenden Euphorie. Denn selbst unsere Unzulänglichkeit feiert ihr Fest. Wir sind die Autoren unseres eigenen Ichs, Co-Autoren eines gigantischen Dostojewski Romans, mit Clowns als Hauptdarstellern. Dieses universale Ding, das wir als Welt bezeichnen, ist nichts weiter, als die Gelegenheit, zu zeigen, wie aufregend Entfremdung sein kann."""

Well, you fell on the concrete and nearly broke you ass, and you were bleeding all over the place, and I rushed you out to the hospital. You remember that?
Yes, I do
Well there's something I never told you about that night
What didn't you tell me?
While you were sitting in the back seat smoking a cigarette you thought was gonna be your last, I was falling deep, deeply in love with you, and I never told you 'til just now!
Aww!

[Chorus: Both]
Oh, home, let me come home
Home is whenever I'm with you
Oh, home, let me come home
Home is where I'm alone with you

[Outro: Jade & Alexander]
Home, let me come home
Home is wherever I'm with you
Home, yes I am home
Home is when I'm alone with you

Alabama, Arkansas
I do love my Ma and Pa
Moats and boats and waterfalls
Alleyways and payphone calls

(Oh home) Home
(Oh home) Home
Home is wherever I'm with you
(Oh home) Home
(Oh home) Home
Home is when I'm alone with you"

[Verso 1]
Desde pequeño quería ser beisbolista, no llegué
Así que aprendí a batear hits por encima de una pista
Volví a tomar alcohol en mi despacho
Escribo bien sobrio pero escribo mejor borracho
Cuando caigo en depresión mis problemas se los cuento a la ventana del avión
El estrés me tiene enfermo, hace 10 año' que no duermo
El IRS me sigue investigando
Me estoy divorciando, pero no importa, yo sigo rimando
Cometo errores pero hago lo que pueda
Aprendí a aterrizar sin ruedas, y…
Aunque en la calle me reconocen, ya ni mis amigo' me conocen
Estoy triste y me río
El concierto está lleno pero yo estoy vacío
En la industria de la música todo es mentira
Mi hijo tiene que comer, así que sigo de gira
Solo me queda lo que tengo
No sé pa' dónde voy pero sé de donde vengo
Me crié con Christopher, mi pana
Tiramo' piedra' juntos, rompimo' un par de ventana'
Corríamo' por la calle sin camiseta en las parcela' de Trujillo, cuesta abajo en bicicleta
La bici encima del barro, con un vaso de plástico en la goma pa' que suene como un carro
Recargábamos batería con malta india y pan con ajo, nadie no' detenía
Eramo' inseparable' hasta que un día lo mataron entre cuatro policía'
Mi alegría sigue rota, se apagaron la' luce' en el parque de pelota'

[Estribillo]
Ya no queda casi nadie aquí
A veces ya no quiero estar aquí
Me siento solo aquí en el medio de la fiesta
Quiero estar en donde nadie me molesta
Quemar mi libreta, soltar mis maleta'
Quiero llamar al 755-0822, a ver quién contesta

[Verso 2]
Las pelea' con mi padrastro cuando perdía el control
Las resolvía con él viendo un partido de béisbol
Me invitó a palear un par de vece'
Me escapé de casa un par de vece'
Pero nunca faltó el alimento
Nos defendió con música tocando en casamiento'
A vece' al horno, a vece' de lata y microonda'
Compartíamos todo, la mesa era redonda
Clase media-baja, nunca fuimo' dueño'
El préstamo del banco se robaba nuestro' sueño'
La cuenta de ahorro vacía pero mami bailando flamenco nos alegraba el día
Dejó de actuar pa' cuidarno' a los cuatro'
Y nos convertimo' en su obra de teatro
Ella se puso nuestra' bota'
Y su vida fue de nuestro' logro' y nuestra' derrota'
Mi padrastro se fue con otros pece'
Nos mudamo' de la Calle 13
Me fui a buscar la suerte en un mar de paja'
Y mi vida entera la empaqué en una caja
En la universidad de arte me becaron
A la mitad de mis amigo' los mataron
Empecé a rapear de nuevo, empecé a creer de nuevo
Volví, saqué un disco, me comí el mundo de un mordisco
En Puerto Rico despidieron empleado', insulté al gobernador y quedó televisado
Censuraron cuatro año' de mi calendario
Abuela murió, no me vio tocar en el estadio
Dije to' lo que sentí, me quieren má' afuera que en mi propio paí'
Pero aunque mis cancione' las cante un alemán
Quiero que me entierren en el viejo San Juan
Puede que la tristeza la disimule, pero estoy hecho de arroz con gandule'
Y me duele, no importa que el ron de la madrugada me consuele
Y desde adentro de la pulpa, si la cagué, a mi paí' le dedico cuatro piso' de disculpa'

Y si me contestan, quiero decirles que quiero volver
Que quiero salir de este hotel y desaparecer
Y si me contestan, quiero decirles que quiero bajar el telón
Que a veces me sube la presión, que tengo miedo que se caiga el avión
Que no me importan las gira', los disco', los Grammy
Y que en la Calle 11 quiero volver a ver el cometa Halley con mami
Quiero volver a cuando mis ventana' eran de sol y me despertaba el calor
A cuando me llamaban pa' jugar, a cuando rapeaba sin cobrar
Quiero sacar las carta' del pelota' del envase, volver a robarme segunda base
En verano y navidade', limpiar la casa con mis hermano' escuchando a Rubén Blades
Quiero volver, ir al cine en la semana y llegar a la escuela de arte' en la mañana
Quiero quedarme allí, no quiero salir de allí
Quiero volver a cuando no me dejaban entrar porque me vestía mal
Quiero volver a sentir, a cuando no tenía que fingír
Yo quiero volver a ser yo

Do you ever desire a mother’s embrace
Well we offer them free for every client subscribing now
Remember the first time you ate candy
Check-in now the experience will be yours to keep

Remember how colours they felt so sweet
All you needed was your fantasy to enjoy your day
Go back to the age you could flee reality
We know that you’ve been longing for that feeling for a long time

[Bridge]
Our house throws you back in time to when you were a little child to escape for a while
No more stress no emptiness pure innocence and confidence like when you were just 5

A single drop could be the quickest remedy
A single drop will raise your earliest memories

Yes we know what you want and need come see us night or day

Hey, lady, you, lady
Cursing at your life
You're a discontented mother
And a regimented wife
I've no doubt you dream about
The things you'll never do
But I wish someone had talked to me
Like I wanna talk of you

[Verse 2]
Ooo, I've been to Georgia
And California
And anywhere I could run
Took the hand of a preacher man
And we made love in the sun
But I ran out of places and friendly faces
Because I had to be free

[Chorus]
I've been to paradise
But I've never been to me

[Verse 3]
Please lady, please, lady
Don't just walk away
'Cause I have this need to tell you
Why I'm all alone today
I can see so much of me
Still living in your eyes
Won't you share a part
Of a weary heart
That has lived a million lives

[Verse 4]
Oh, I've been to Nice
And the isle of Greece
When I sipped champagne on a yacht
I moved like Harlow in Monte Carlo
And showed 'em what I've got
I've been undressed by kings
And I've seen some things
That a woman ain't supposed to see

[Chorus]
I've been to paradise
But I've never been to me

[Spoken Verse 5]
Hey, you know what paradise is?
It's a lie
A fantasy we created about people and places
As we'd like them to be
But you know what truth is?
It's that little baby you're holding
And it's that man you fought with this morning
The same one you're going to make love with tonight
That's truth, that's love

[Verse 6]
Sometimes I've been to crying
For unborn children
That might have made me complete
But I, I took the sweet life I never knew
I'd be bitter from the sweet
I've spent my life exploring
The subtle whoring
That costs too much to be free

[Chorus]
Hey lady, I've been to paradise
But I've never been to me
I've been to paradise
Never been to me

[Outro]
I've been to Georgia and California
And anywhere I could run
I've been to paradise
Never been to me
Been to Nice and the isle of Greece
When I've sipped champagne on a yacht
I've been to paradise
Never been to me"

Multi-love
Checked into my heart and trashed it like a hotel room
Who is your God, where is she?
She wants to bury me in Austin under Uchiko
She don't want to be your man or woman
She wants to be your love

All of the other stalker daughters dragged her under
May all her minds be made up
I'll be her Vicodin, expired and escaped to Valhalla
She don't want to be your man or woman

Multi-love's got me on my knee
We were one, then become three
Mama, what have you done to me?
I'm half crazy

It's not that this song's about her

The sun shines underneath us
Fearing new kinds of mind control and just blaming each other
She don't want to be your man or woman
She wants to be your love

Blue tits, right wing sex tips
Quick pull it out the bin Alice, let’s sell it
Ebay it, rough bars, mixing tunes
We be purple polo lards, broke down on snake pass
You cunt make it up, we be fat ass fat men, Starbucks anthem
Subway, we’re gonna take you down in the subway at midnight
Two shot mocha, wee wee spliff, dogger on the look out

Oh really? Humanist as opposed to your shop floor representatives
Oh no, dirty overall creased machine, I did a Thatcher
I got myself on a business scheme L-T-D
Now look at me comrade, I’m always fucking home for tea
No grovel, punch the card four week notice, notice me
Pissed out me head, key to the city

Trying to keep a brave face whilst his nose was runnin’
Should of trained him properly
If ya don’t take to it you get thrown off the lorry
Dusty trail, rusty rockets won’t stop it
His palace ain’t libel, Hugo Boss took it off, so what?
A celeb do will not justify you, end of no flash articles
No Flash Harry, no flash articles, I know people care
We all fucking care, but care don’t dare it even scratch the surface
It don’t even acknowledge small bumps smooth surface

Now he stuck in a cell, know he feeling nauseous
The nigga so good, he was so cold
Another lost kid, Mo City soul

Hard times like, ""Yah!""
Bad trips like, ""Yah!""

I'm fucked up, homie, you fucked up
But if God got us, then we gon' be alright

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright

Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, and when I wake up
I recognize you're looking at me for the pay cut
But homicide be looking at you from the face down
What MAC-11 even boom with the bass down?
Schemin', and let me tell you 'bout my life
Painkillers only put me in the twilight
Where pretty pussy and Benjamin is the highlight
Now tell my momma I love her, but this what I like, Lord knows
Twenty of 'em in my Chevy, tell 'em all to come and get me
Reaping everything I sow, so my karma coming heavy
No preliminary hearings on my record
I'm a motherfucking gangster in silence for the record, uh
Tell the world I know it's too late
Boys and girls, I think I've gone cray
Drown inside my vices all day
Won't you please believe when I say
[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Wouldn't you know
We been hurt, been down before
Nigga, when our pride was low
Lookin' at the world like, ""Where do we go?""
Nigga, and we hate po-po
Wanna kill us dead in the street fo sho'
Nigga, I'm at the preacher's door
My knees gettin' weak, and my gun might blow
But we gon' be alright

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams]
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
What you want you, a house⁠? You, a car?
40 acres and a mule? A piano, a guitar?
Anything, see my name is Lucy, I'm your dog
Motherfucker, you can live at the mall
I can see the evil, I can tell it, I know it's illegal
I don't think about it, I deposit every other zero
Thinking of my partner, put the candy, paint it on the Regal
Digging in my pocket, ain't a profit big enough to feed you
Every day my logic get another dollar just to keep you
In the presence of your chico... Ah!
I don't talk about it, be about it, every day I sequel
If I got it then you know you got it, Heaven, I can reach you
Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, my dog, that's all
Bick back and Chad, I trap the bag for y'all
I rap, I black on track so rest assured
My rights, my wrongs; I write 'til I'm right with God
[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Wouldn't you know
We been hurt, been down before
Nigga, when our pride was low
Lookin' at the world like, ""Where do we go?""
Nigga, and we hate po-po
Wanna kill us dead in the street fo sho'

My knees gettin' weak, and my gun might blow

Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar & Thundercat]
I keep my head up high
I cross my heart and hope to die
Lovin' me is complicated
Too afraid of a lot of changes
I'm alright, and you're a favorite
Dark nights in my prayers
[Poem: Kendrick Lamar]
I remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room
I didn't wanna self-destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went runnin' for answers"

I freed a couple of souls, just yesterday, oh yeah

[Verse]
Uh, I had a good girl in my room, no tats on her skin
I put work all in her purse, she got guilt all in her grin
And I swear it be the same, every fuckin' where that I been
All you girls try to be saints, I’ll make you roll with a sinner
You can come to my hotel, you can bring me a friend
You can dress up like twins, I can teach you some French
Paper planes full of kush, a couple cups full of gin
Don't know what city I'm in, wake up and do it again
And if you know me well, you know I don't like to talk
But when I make a move, you know it's loud as fuck
And if you wanna scream, get loud as fuck, baby
I can tell you've earned a bit of deconstruction
A little bit, a little bit, ooh yeah, ooh Lord

Your hesitation speaks to me louder than million words per minute
I was born to this life you're living, in this game, oh yeah
Said, said nothing will ever be... ever be the same, when you're finished
I freed a couple of souls, just yesterday, oh-oh, baby, ooh
[Bridge]
Do you feel like you'll come back around?
Does it make you strong?
Do you feel like you can take the planet on? Oh girl
Did I seem to give you a little bit more love?
To your gloomy life, to your empty life, uh
Little life, little lie, oh yeah
Do you feel like you got your money's worth?
'Cause if you did this round's on me
Just promise that you'll come back to me
Feed me, baby, feed me, baby

[Chorus]
Your hesitation speaks to me louder than million words per minute
I was born to this life you're living, in this game, baby, ooh
Said nothing will ever be... ever be the same, when you're finished
I freed a couple of souls, just yesterday, baby, ooh-ooh"

Que lleva sobre sus varas mi nombre grabado a fuego

Nick Wiz, turn my headphones up, man
Uh, uh

[Hook]
Ayo, if you miss Hip-Hop, then stand up
Reminisce when this drop, get amped up
Any hit that's this hot is an anthem
Do ya' dance, love, she need a hand, breh
Lyricist that spit pop get stamped up
Hit or miss, then flip-flop, them clam up
They fearing this to hit blocks and slam clubs
Put yo' hands up, here ya' man come

[Verse 1]
Its mister word renowned with the best verse
One of the illest the streets, from the east to the west, heard
Get greeted with ghetto gestures like ""yessir""
A pre-meditated killer for the way I stretch words
Some of us love to flow 'til the club close
And some in love with blow for the love of dough
In it for fortune and fame, flamboyant for gurls
They extorting the game, exploiting the hood
Rappers ride for bread while the gossip spread
It's only hot cause we ride, spotted cops with feds
Plus, lots of heads go Pop instead
That's the word on the block is, ""Hip-Hop Is Dead""
So consumers quit copping, rappers flip-flopping
Artist pimped by they labels like a slave pick cotton
Pop Charts killing underground Hip-Hopers
While the world still looking for Ra like Bin Laden, let's go

Me and my dude's the new cool in the game
That Old-School feel with the New-School slang
The boomerang with the true duke flame
Shoot through yo' brain like smoking poom-shoong-pang
Ghetto galactic, the next level and back shit
Something like heroine, crack, mixed
The combination of Mike and Lebron, the life of a don
Yeah, just give the God the mic and it's on
My brand new vision gives you aneurisms
My fans'll listen, see my words like its camera's in 'em
We just anxious to bust like a new fo'-pound
So, the hood is reacquainted to the New York sound
Every verse is a mountain of proof, a man of my words
Even on the curb when I'm out of the booth
My style's the truth, unlimited amounts to produce
And my flow still tight when I'm about to get loose, let's go

The boogey-down, the buck-town mic flavor
I'm in yo' hoods like neighbors
Operation shut down, 0-60 like ""later""
It's rider, up-town, high-top, nike lacer
In the gut of the beast where they don't dwell
The gut of the streets but they don't sell
I still hold mics and stay so real
My flow tight with mo' sight's than AOL
I change climates like a plane pilot
Cause hurricanes and rain violent
Crack yo' skull, snatch yo' brain out it, uou out ya' mind if it ain't talent
And keep it out yo' rhymes if you ain't bought it
Raps tsunami, the track's behind me
Cats that try me, the raps too grimey

Clap with a body and tap punani

Campo de amapolas, risa de jazmín en primavera
Brote de trigo que me hace vibrar
De la cabeza a los pies, 24/7 todo el mes
Quiero gritar, si, quiero gritar
Quiero que me escuche entera toda la ciudad
Porque deseo montarte, engrasando cada pieza
Durmiendo cada parte, eterna como atenas eres
Selene, que me hiciste, que me das
Porque brilla tanto la ciudad
Creo que se me ha subido el corazón a la cabeza

Hiciste que los días no pasaran en vano
Plantaste sandías por navidad
Conseguiste que el invierno me supiera a verano
Hiciste que brotaran de la noche a la mañana
Violetas y mimosas con solo una palmada
Y entonces lo vi claro, sí
No todas las verduras combinan con pescado
Y guardamos la bandera en la nevera
Y nos fuimos de la mano a cruzar la tierra
Y comimos sushi, y comimos cuscús
Y comimos ceviche, y bebimos limoncello

Eres más majetuosa que el Tourmalet
Tienes mas curvas que Alpe d'Huez
Y me elevas más alto que el Galibier
Ya sabes que me gusta tanto el ciclismo
Y se que a ti estos nombres te suenan a chino
Ella son mis montañas, son mis catedrales
El lugar donde este hombre negocia con sus males
Y tu estas allí en cada pedaleo
En cada paella
En cada repecho
En cada diente de mi plato pequeño, y de piñón grande

Give, always give what you can
Even if your allies draw lines in the sand
And dig, always dig a little deeper
Sometimes it’s hard to be my brother’s keeper
Love. So you let love in
Baby, I am home in the wake of your skin, and it’s crazy
How we wear our ceremony
Always be open to your path and your journey
Yes, she cradles my loneliness
A home that I forage, nest
Universal test, feel the weight of my love
Put your hand on my chest
And rest, in the cradle of my arms
The battle that we face is the place where our scars come from
And to pick up the gun
My love, we are destined to teach these ones to be brave
And never run away
Courage is birthed from the womb on the first light of day
Yeah, the day you were born, you came out perfect
Never meant to be torn
In silence, never been so loud in the violence
Never been so proud of a people
When we’re fighting for a change
Not afraid to lose it all despite all the rage
We are animals
And we cannot be caged
Provoke us to fight
So we burn a little sage and write poetry
Wiser than the enemy will ever be
The minority
And authority
Are you here to protect or arrest me?
I can’t tolerate the hate, and I'm losing sleep
Can’t breathe, cause they’re choking out a war in me
Immorality
[Chorus]
Love letters to God
Wonder if she reads them or if they get lost
In the stars, the stars, in the stars
So many parts to a heavy heart
If there’s no beginning, then where would you start?
Start, start, where would you start?

[Verse 2]
Human souls, so we carve 'em into story Totem poles
Because we’re always searching for a certain goal
A pattern of physics, a role
Don’t believe all you’re told
And open
Open up your fist
A misconception, you can fight like this
In praise, with the power of prayer
If God’s on our side, we can take the stairs
To the heavens
Flipping through my chapter seven
I live with the snakes in the great deception
No court, in this country for men
Who steal from their mother on paper with pen
And we’re tripping
Down a red dirt road
And we’re asking
Is this the way we should go?
Kissing, soft top feet of my goddess
We walk the earth, baby, yeah we got this
Focus, and it’s redirected
Grateful, and I’m resurrected
Stubborn, but I know the way
You’re the skin of my drum
To your rhythm I will sway
Take my hand
I won’t lead you astray
We will not go gently into the darkest of days
Grandma’s here, and she says persevere
Take a walk in her moccs, taste the trail of tears
And our fears, are the same as they ever were
Beers, numb the pain of a holocaust
Gears, always mobbing in motion
Maybe, baby, be an island or an ocean
Your arches, how they bend and contract on my conscience
Never slipped through the grip of my thesis
And my theory is I shine in your presence
A deliverance
[Chorus]
Love letters to God
Wonder if she reads them or if they get lost
In the stars, the stars, in the stars
So many parts to a heavy heart
If there’s no beginning, then where would you start?
Start, start, where would you start?"

You'll fire your musket but I'll run you through
So when you're waiting for the next attack

But on this battlefield no one wins
The smell of acrid smoke and horse's breath
As I plunge on into certain death

We won't live to fight another day

And as I lay forgotten and alone
Without a tear I draw my parting groan

I often sit
There in the sea
And dream dreams
And hope hopes
And wish wishes
And lately
As I listen to the wind song
As it dances a beautiful dance for me
But these moments
Never seem to last to long
Because after the hopes
The dreams, and the wishes
You got the singin' of the dancin' wind
After you and me
And a stolen moment of happines
After a glimpse
Of the timeless, natural universe
Moving in effortless effervesce
Starts when rhythm
Yeah
Moving in effortless effervesce
Starts when beauty
Comes, comes the reality of today
Grinning it's all-knowing, fiendish grin
Knowing everything I say
Everything I feel
Everything I think
Every gesture I make today, today
Pressing his ugly face against mine
Staring at me with lifeless eyes
Crumbling away all memories of yesterday's dreams
Crumbling away
Crumbling hopes and destroying wishes
Destroying dreams
Can't even get close to nobody no more
No matter how much you try
You can't get close to nobody no more
Because today is a killer
And only you can save us Lord
Only you can save us Lord
I never dreamed
I certainly never hoped
That one day
I'd be screamin'
'Bout something my mother told me I needed
In the beginnin'
In the beginnin'
In the beginnin'

Yes Lord
Ooh my Lord (Hallelujah)
Oh my Lord (Hallelujah)
Oh my Lord (Hallelujah)
Oh my Sweet Lord (Hallelujah)
I really wanna see you (Hallelujah)
I really wanna be with you (Hallelujah)
I really wanna see you (Hallelujah)
But it takes so long my Lord (Hallelujah)
Oh my Lord(Hallelujah)
Oh my Lord (Hallelujah)
My sweet Lord (Hallelujah)
I really wanna see ya (Hallelujah)
I've got to see you (Hallelujah)
I really wanna see ya (Hallelujah)
But it takes so long, my Lord (Hallelujah)
Oh my Lord (Hallelujah) (My Lord)
Oh my Lord (Hallelujah)
My sweet Lord (Hallelujah)
Oh my Lord (Hallelujah)
My Hallelujah (Hallelujah)
Hallelujah (Hallelujah)
Hallelujah (Hallelujah)
Takes so long, my Lord
Oh Lord, takes so long
Hope it doesn't take too long this time
Cause I need to be with you
I need to be with you
I need to be with you, Lord
Today
Today
Today
Today
Today, who are you Lord
You are a killer (Hallelujah) (Aaa)"

I'm so tired of playing
Playing with this bow and arrow
Gonna give my heart away
Leave it to the other girls to play
For I've been a temptress too long
Just...

[Chorus]
Give me a reason to love you
Give me a reason to be a woman
I just wanna be a woman

[Verse 2]
From this time, unchained
We're all looking at a different picture
Through this new frame of mind
A thousand flowers could bloom
Move over and give us some room, yeah

[Chorus]
Give me a reason to love you
Give me a reason to be a woman
I just wanna be a woman

[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
So don't you stop being a man
Just take a little look
From outside when you can
Sow a little tenderness
No matter if you cry

[Chorus]
Give me a reason to love you
Give me a reason to be a woman
I just wanna be a woman

[Bridge]
It's all I wanna be, is all, a woman
For this is the beginning
Of forever and ever
It's time to move over
It's all I wanna be

[Outro]
I'm so tired of playing
Playing with this bow and arrow
Gonna give my heart away
Leave it to the other girls to play
For I've been a temptress too long
Just
Give me a reason to love you"
